**Purefusion TorrentBridge** is a blazing-fast, modular Chrome extension that lets you instantly send `.torrent` and magnet links to your favorite BitTorrent clients — directly from the right-click context menu or custom UI panel.

> Originally forked from **Torrent Clipper** and inspired by **Torrent Control**, this next-generation extension is fully refactored, rebranded, and re-energized for today’s web — and tomorrow’s.
